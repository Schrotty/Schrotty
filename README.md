### Oh, Hi There 👋

#### Bit about me

I am 30, a student, programmer with a heart for bugs, and most of the time confused about what I am doing.
Most of my projects here are just for fun and often experimental or stupid as hell.
I love bad JavaScript jokes as much I love tea and I love tea a lot! 🍵

#### Languages

My preferred languages are either Scala or C#, but I also use PHP, Java, Python, and some JavaScript/ TypeScript.

#### Frameworks and Tools

My IDE to go is right now IntelliJ for scala and everything related to the JVM. Visual Studio for all the dotnet related things, and vs-code for some casual experiments.
The frameworks I used to work with the most are the Akka framework for actors and ANTLR for parsing data.
For my web projects I prefer Vue.js and Tailwind CSS.
And, as you can see, git is no stranger to me.

### Projects

Some of my old projects:

* [Onyx - QR-Generator](https://github.com/Schrotty/onyx-qr-generator) 🏷️

  A basic qr-code generator build with flask-restful and vue.js.

* [DartRogue](https://github.com/Schrotty/DartRogue) 🔪

  A simple dungeon crawler written in dart.

* [CMTC](https://github.com/Schrotty/CMTC) ⏩

   An LLVM compiler for the cymbol language. One of my projects for studies.

* [Cereal](https://github.com/Schrotty/Cereal) 🥛

   This is one of these experimental projects. It's a compiler for a custom java dialect, which is mostly designed around my favorite topic: Breakfast, or more specific: cereal.
It's more a fun project than something serious.

* [Project Pricefield](https://github.com/punkIRC/punkIRC-test) 🐳

   A test client for IRC servers, which are written by the students at the TH Lübeck in the course "Distributed Systems". It's built with the Akka framework, ANTLR, and StringTemplate.

* [Thunder-Remote](https://github.com/Schrotty/thunder-remote) 🚗

   A modified version of the 'pyController' package for usage with a ThunderBorg. Supports multiple controller layouts which can be customized. Part of a bigger project during my studies.
