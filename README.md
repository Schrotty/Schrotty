### Oh, Hi There üëã

#### Bit about me

I am 27, a student, programmer with a heart for bugs, and most of the time confused about what I am doing.
Most of my projects here are just for fun and often experimental or stupid as hell.
I love bad javascript jokes as much I love tea and I love tea a lot! üçµ

#### Languages

My preferred languages are either scala or c#, but I also use java, some python, and sometimes even some javascript, even though front-end is not one of my strengths.

#### Frameworks and Tools

My IDE to go is right now IntelliJ for scala and everything related to the JVM. Visual Studio for all the dotnet related things, and vs-code for some casual experiments.
The frameworks I used to work with the most are the Akka framework for actors and ANTLR for parsing data.
And, as you can see, git is no stranger to me.

### Projects

Right now I am working on my bachelor thesis and therefore I am not working actively at a specific project, but I can show you some of my old projects:

* [DartRogue](https://github.com/Schrotty/DartRogue) üî™

  A simple dungeon crawler written in dart.

* [CMTC](https://github.com/Schrotty/CMTC) ‚è©

   An LLVM compiler for the cymbol language. One of my projects for studies.

* [Cereal](https://github.com/Schrotty/Cereal) ü•õ

   This is one of these experimental projects. It's a compiler for a custom java dialect, which is mostly designed around my favorite topic: Breakfast, or more specific: cereal.
It's more a fun project than something serious.

* [Project Pricefield](https://github.com/punkIRC/punkIRC-test) üê≥

   A test client for IRC servers, which are written by the students at the TH L√ºbeck in the course "Distributed Systems". It's built with the Akka framework, ANTLR, and StringTemplate.

* [Thunder-Remote](https://github.com/Schrotty/thunder-remote) üöó

   A modified version of the 'pyController' package for usage with a ThunderBorg. Supports multiple controller layouts which can be customized. Part of a bigger project during my studies.
